# SimpleHTTP
Simple HTTP Java server, educational purposes only. Demonstrates TCP/IP using Java

The server is only capable of sending HTML, only accepts GET.
The HTTP response is set to always respond as OK as this was used to test against a very outdated client that couldn't handle the proper responses. The correct responses are provided and commented out.
